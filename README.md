## AlphaZero - a reinforcement learning based game playing algorithm

We are trying to re-implement a reinforcement learning based algorithm from the principles explained in the DeepMind papers on AlphaZero. This approach to learning gameplay has been shown to be extremely successful in games like Chess, Go and Shogi and can be inferred to work equally well in other perfect information turn based games with 2 players.
